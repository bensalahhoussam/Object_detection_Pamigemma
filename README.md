# Object_detection_Paligemma


## Architecture of Paligemma
The architecture of Paligemma can be divided into several key components:

Input Processing Module:

Vision Processing: This module processes visual inputs using advanced vision models such as SigLIP.
Language Processing: This module handles textual inputs using the Gemma language model.
Multimodal Fusion Layer:

This layer integrates outputs from both the vision and language processing modules to create a unified representation. Techniques like cross-modal attention mechanisms are often used here.
